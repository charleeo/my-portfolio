                I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience in developing enterprise solutions.

                <p>
                My skills set are in PHP, Laravel, Node.JS, MySQL and React. I have worked in both start-up environments as well as some large corporate organizations and this has given me the needed experience in telling usersâ€™ story and also transforming same into real projects. I love to work in a team but can also work in isolation and still deliver good results.
